This is a brief description of this demo.

To run this demo, you have to do a lot of preparations. (Sadly, the most important thing is that you need to have a kinect running first)

1. Follow Dr.Juan's post(https://www.edmodo.com/post/421217073), make sure you did everything correct.
2. Start the tracker by running: roslaunch rbx1_vision openni_tracker.launch
3. Seeing the skeleton on rviz by running: rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find rbx1_vision`/skeleton_frames.rviz
4. Starting you simulator by running: roslaunch baxter_gazebo baxter_world.launch

Finally, you can choose one version to run. V3 is the most accuracy one(shaking a lot), V4 reduces some shaking, V5 is accuracy and smooth(recommended), V6 and V7 is still updating.

(Sorry for push it so late, we are really busy these days. If you have any suggestion, please contact 769845081@qq.com or 271462243@qq.com)
