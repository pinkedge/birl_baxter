you need to install everything in chapter 9 of the book 'ros_by_example_indigo_volume_1'

the put everything in this file into /your_baxter_ws/src/baxter_examples/scripts

then run:
    roslaunch rbx1_speech voice_nav_commands.launch
    rosrun baxter_examples voice_nav.py
    rosrun sound_play soundplay_node.py
    rosrun baxter_interface joint_trajectory_action_server.py

I don't write a launch file because some things need to do at the same time

use it with face_tracker
