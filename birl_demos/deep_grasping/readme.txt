This code is the project of LiuZhendong(7077804@qq.com) and XiaoGang.
This project, which is initially from Cornell University, demonstrates a number of intelligent grasps using Baxter as implemented through a deep learning algorithm. 

Now the project is not completely done, cause a few files in package baxter_grasping are missing. such as Package.xml and cmakelist.txt.
