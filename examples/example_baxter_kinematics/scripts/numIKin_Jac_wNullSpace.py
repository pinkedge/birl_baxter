# Overview:
#-----------------------------------------
# In this program we implement a numerical approach to inverse kinematics by using the Jacobian manipulator.
# In addition, we also make use of redundancy and the null space to achieve secondary goals in our solution.
# So, a reference cartesian location is given to the program. The error is computed and converted into a 
# joint angle perturbation that is added to the current joint angles. The error direction moves the joint angles
# towards the goal position. Further, we create a secondary goal, there are many possibilities:
# 	i) Move a single joint angle in a particular direction to avoid reaching a limit, or 
# 	ii) Move all joints towards the center of their joint motion range. This can be done by computing those center 
# 	positions and subtracting the current joint angles. This gives an error measure in joint angles.
# 
# About the Jabocian:
# The use of the Jaobian is not always evident. It works best with certain size perturbations. If the perturbations are
# too large the motions are uncontrolled. If the motions are too small, one may never reach the desired goal.
#
# About the null space and projections:
# After calculating the null space N, we will obtain a non-square matrix. This is in-effect a set of column vectors of joint
# angles whose linear combination will always result (when multiplied by the Jacobian) in a zero vector. 
# This non-square matrix can be turned into a projection matrix by multiplying the the null space times its inverse 
# (since this is not a square matrix, we multiply times the pseudo-inverse). The projection matrix can then be used to
# project any other joint-angle column vector into the null-space. This joint-angle vector actually represents dq, a
# joint angle velocity or perturbation. It is best represented by an error measure. If you have a desired joint angle state
# then subtract the current joint angle state to compute an error. This error should then be scaled to a size that works 
# well with the jacobian (otherwise it will result in an unstable motion). It is important to explicitly check to make sure
# the update is small. If it is not, it should not be used to move the joints.
#
# TODO:
# We have not yet checked for singularity conditions in the Jacobian. This can be done by studying the size of the determinant.
# If we are reaching a singularity condition, a recovery behavior should be effected. The motion path of the robot should be modified.
# 
# Requirements:
# baxter_PyKDL is needed and found at: http://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Baxter_PyKDL
